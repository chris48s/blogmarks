Last week I tried out [diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/) to knock up some cloud infrastructure diagrams. There are several things I really like about this tool:

- The learning curve is very easy. I was able to absorb the key concepts and produce a useful diagram showing the AWS setup for an application I am working on within about 30 mins of installing it for the first time.
- The [effort in]:[pretty pictures out] ratio is very satisfying.
- Because the diagram is generated from code, it can live in your repo. The diff changing the diagram could be in the same commit as the updates to your CDK definitions or ansible playbooks or whatever it is that actually makes the infrastructure changes.

For example, the following diagram

![example diagram](/images/diagram.png)

is generated from this short python snippet:

```py
from diagrams import Cluster, Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import Fargate
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS, ElastiCache
from diagrams.aws.engagement import SES
from diagrams.aws.network import ELB, Route53
from diagrams.aws.storage import S3

with Diagram("", show=False):
    ses = SES("Mail Transport (SES)")
    dns = Route53("Route 53 (DNS)")
    s3 = S3("S3")

    with Cluster("VPC"):
        lb = ELB("Load Balancer (ALB)")
        elasticache = ElastiCache("Redis (ElastiCache)")

        with Cluster("ECS"):
            web = Fargate("web")

        with Cluster("DB Cluster (RDS)"):
            db_primary = RDS("primary")
            db_primary - RDS("read replica")

    dns >> lb
    lb >> web

    web >> elasticache
    web >> db_primary
    web >> s3
    web >> ses
```
