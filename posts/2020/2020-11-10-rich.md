I gave [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) a spin recently and its an absolute game-changer when it comes to building nice looking terminal interfaces in python. Rich provides elegant high-level abstractions for using colours, tables, markdown and more. See the [README](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/README.md) and [API docs](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more detailed showcase of Rich's capabilities.
