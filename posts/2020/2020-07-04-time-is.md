I often need to schedule meetings with participants in multiple timezones. My favourite feature of [time.is](https://time.is) is the ability to easily assemble a link like [https://time.is/1400_3_Jul_2020_in_London/CEST/Toronto](https://time.is/1400_3_Jul_2020_in_London/CEST/Toronto) using a mix of geographic locations and timezone abbreviations. If you co-ordinate across multiple timezones a lot, this website is very useful and has a number of handy [shortcuts and customisations](https://time.is/howto) available.
