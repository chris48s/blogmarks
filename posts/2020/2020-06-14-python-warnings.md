I've encountered python warnings before and I've used python's `-W` flag to configure displaying them, but I'd never really given much thought to how warnings are raised in userland code until I read this article - [Working with warnings in Python](https://lerner.co.il/2020/04/27/working-with-warnings-in-python/). This is a language feature to use infrequently, but worth having in the back pocket when maintaining libraries.
