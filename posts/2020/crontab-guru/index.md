It doesn't matter how long I use it for, crontab syntax is one of those things is one of those things I just can't commit to memory. It's not _complicated_, just somewhat unintuitive. Fortunately [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) is a crontab syntax checker which translates crontab expressions into natural language.
