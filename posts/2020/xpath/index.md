I use Xpath selectors infrequently enough that I can never really remember the syntax off the top of my head. Fortunately [this reference](https://devhints.io/xpath) usually gets me through. [Devhints](https://devhints.io/) also has a wide variety of other cheat sheets but this is the one I keep on coming back to.
