[Mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/) is a simple and very useful service for developing code that sends email. Set up a project inbox, tell your application to use `smtp.mailtrap.io`/port `2525` for mail transport and give it the username and password for your project inbox. Any emails your application sends (regardless of the outward address) are swallowed (no danger of spamming a real user with test emails) and emails can be reviewed in the project inbox. The free plan is generous enough to cover moderate usage.
