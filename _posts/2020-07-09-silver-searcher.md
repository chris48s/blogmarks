## [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)

The Silver Searcher (or `ag` to its friends) has quickly become my go-to search tool for code. Performance gets top billing, but this tool has a number of other handy features. For example, searching ignores patterns in your `.gitignore` by default and `ag` is aware of a large number of programming languages and technologies. For example `ag "search string" . --html` searches only in files with the extensions `.htm`, `.html`, `.shtml` or `.xhtml`.
