## Post JSON to an API with curl

Increasingly this is becoming just a place to store snippets and one-liners that are a bit too long to remember.

```sh
curl "https://my-api/endpoint" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: f00ba2" \
  --data '{"my": "payload", "foo": "bar"}' \
  --include
```
