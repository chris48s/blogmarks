## Using `find -exec`

[Find](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/) has a useful option `-exec` which can be used to run a command on each file found. It has a couple of slightly obscure details to the syntax:

- `{}` is a placeholder for the filename.
- The command we are running with `-exec` needs to be terminated with a semicolon as there may be further arguments to find after it. This needs to be escaped as `\;` or `';'`, otherwise it will be interpreted as the end of the `find` command.


It is also possible to pass the `-exec` argument multiple times

Stringing this together allows us to assemble some elegant one-liners, for example:

```bash
# delete log files more than 60 days old
find ./logs -mtime +60 -name '*.log' -exec rm {} \;

# print the name and (array/object) length of all JSON files
find . -name '*.json' -exec printf {}\:\  \; -exec jq '. | length' {} \;

# recursively change permissions on files (ignore directories)
find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```
