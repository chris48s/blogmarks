## [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) and [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)

Two for one this time. These tools are two peas in a pod:

* [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is a git-aware drop-in replacement for `cat` with syntax highlighting.
* [Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) builds on bat's syntax themes to provide a pager for git with improved diff highlighting.

I use both with the Nord theme. Git can be configured to use the delta/Nord combo as the default pager by setting

```ini
[core]
    pager = delta --theme=Nord

[interactive]
    diffFilter = delta --color-only --theme=Nord
```

in `.gitconfig`.
