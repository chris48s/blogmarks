## [Working In Public](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software-ebook/dp/B08BDGXVK9)

Nadia Eghbal (who previously authored the seminal report [Roads & Bridges](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/)) recently released her first full-length book [Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software-ebook/dp/B08BDGXVK9). Working in Public presents an updated, more nuanced and more refined take on the challenges faced by open source developers and maintainers. As ever, Nadia's superpower is to take the experiences we all feel in the open source community and package them in a way that makes the topic accessible for a new and much wider audience.
